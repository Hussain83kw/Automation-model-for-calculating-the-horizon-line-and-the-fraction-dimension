# Automation-model-for-calculating-the-horizon-line-and-the-fraction-dimension
The function of the codes is to calculate the skyline and extract the fractal dimension calculation, in addition to having outputs such as graphs and processed images, a model for classifying the level of complexity of the skyline, and the level of visual pollution based on the range (1-2) of the fractal dimension.
